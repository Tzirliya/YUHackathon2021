# YUHackathon2021
This hackathon project was created by me and two teammates on May 2, 2021.
The project aims to aid Computer Science students by visualizing concepts such as sorts. The website consists of a login system and a page that contains different concepts for students to explore. As proof of concept, a webpage that visualizes bubble sort with step-by-step explanations was implemented. JavaScript was used to animate the changes.
